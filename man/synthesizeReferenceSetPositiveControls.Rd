\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An R object of type \code{ConnectionDetails} created using the
function \code{createConnectionDetails} in the
\code{DatabaseConnector} package.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{A database schema containing health care data in the OMOP Commond
Data Model. Note that for SQL Server, botth the database and schema
should be specified, e.g. 'cdm_schema.dbo'}

\item{oracleTempSchema}{Should be used in Oracle to specify a schema where the user has
write priviliges for storing temporary tables.}

\item{outcomeDatabaseSchema}{The database schema where the target outcome table is located. Note
that for SQL Server, both the database and schema should be
specified, e.g. 'cdm_schema.dbo'}

\item{outcomeTable}{The name of the table where the outcomes will be stored.}

\item{exposureDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that is the location where the
exposure data used to define the exposure cohorts is available.  If
exposureTable = DRUG_ERA, exposureDatabaseSchema is not used and
assumed to be cdmDatabaseSchema.  Requires read permissions to this
database.}

\item{exposureTable}{The tablename that contains the exposure cohorts.  If exposureTable
<> DRUG_ERA, then expectation is exposureTable has format of COHORT
table: COHORT_DEFINITION_ID, SUBJECT_ID, COHORT_START_DATE,
COHORT_END_DATE.}

\item{referenceSet}{The name of the reference set for which positive controls need to be
synthesized. Currently supported are "ohdsiMethodsBenchmark" and "ohdsiDevelopment".}

\item{maxCores}{How many parallel cores should be used? If more cores are made
available this can speed up the analyses.}

\item{workFolder}{Name of local folder to place intermediary results; make sure to use
forward slashes (/). Do not use a folder on a network drive since
this greatly impacts performance.}

\item{summaryFileName}{The name of the CSV file where to store the summary of the final set
of positive and negative controls.}

\description{
Synthesize positive controls for reference set
}
\details{
This function will synthesize positive controls for a given reference set based on the real
negative controls. Data from the database will be used to fit outcome models for each negative
control outcome, and these models will be used to sample additional synthetic outcomes during
eposure to increase the true hazard ratio.
The positive control outcome cohorts will be stored in the same database table as the negative
control outcome cohorts.
A summary file will be created listing all positive and negative controls. This list should then be
used as input for the method under evaluation.
